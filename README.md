# Astro virtual assistant

Astro is a virtual assistant for console.redhat.com created with [Rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/).

## Development

### Setting up your environment

Astro uses [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/) to manage it's dependencies. 
Follow the [instructions on pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/#installation) to install it.

After installing [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/), you are now ready to install the project development dependencies 
by running:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

This will install [rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/) inside the virtual environment created by
[pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/).
To access it you can run `pipenv run rasa` to execute any 
[rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/) command or `pipenv shell` to start a session within the virtual environment.

> :information_source:  Any command below assumes that you are within a pipenv shell (i.e. after executing `pipenv shell`). If you
> don't want to use that mode, just preprend `pipenv run` to any command.


### File structure

The training files are inside [data](./data) directory. The common files are on the root of this directory and specific
files are in the subfolders. The current approach is to have a directory for the namespace/bundle and a sub-directory 
for the application. Each application can write its own `nlu`, `stories` and `rules` file depending on its needs.

For example, [data/console/rbac/stories.yml](./data/console/rbac/nlu.yml) holds the `nlu` info for `RBAC`.

The custom actions (python code) is found within [actions](./actions) and holds the required code to execute it.

Test files are found in the [tests](./tests) folders.

> :warning: At this point, all the applications share the same [domain.yml](./domain.yml) file and every `intent` must exist in
this file. This might change in the future.

### Training the model

You can run `rasa train` to start a full training session or if appending `--finetune`
you can do an incremental training of your previous model. Note that incremental training doesn't work if you added
new intent or actions.

### Storing the models

The models are by default saved to `./models`.

### Offline Token

To be able to locally run the actions, you need to have a valid offline token for https://sso.redhat.com. 
All the API calls will be made on behalf of the user of this token. You can generate an offline token at
[https://access.redhat.com/management/api](https://access.redhat.com/management/api) by clicking "Generate token".
Copy this token to the environment variable `OFFLINE_REFRESH_TOKEN` (`.env` file is supported).

> :note: If you want to use the stage environment, generate the token at 
> [https://access.stage.redhat.com/management/api](https://access.stage.redhat.com/management/api) and also set the
> environment variable `SSO_REFRESH_TOKEN_URL` to `https://sso.stage.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token`

### Executing

Once you have a trained model, you can run a local chat instance with `rasa shell`.

After setting up your offline token, start the actions server by executing `rasa run actions --auto-reload`.

### Errors when launching

#### Failed to find input channel class for 'channels.console.ConsoleInput'

> RasaException: Failed to find input channel class for 'channels.console.ConsoleInput'. Unknown input channel. Check your credentials configuration to make sure the mentioned channel is not misspelled. If you are creating your own channel, make sure it is a proper name of a class in a module.

This error happens when the class channels.console.ConsoleInput is not found OR the file containing that class fails to load. 
If the later, the error doesn't appear in the console, but we can check it by importing that file.

Running the following should make the error evident or at least give more information.

```bash
python -c "import channels.console"
```
