        Here is how the process works:
        1. I will open a link to sso.redhat.com for you.
        2. In that page, there will be a section named *Two-factor authentication*.
        3. In that section, there is a button named *Set up Authenticator application*.
        4. Once you click that button, you will be asked to reauthenticate.
        5. After you reauthenticate, you will be redirected to a form to set up two-factor authentication.
