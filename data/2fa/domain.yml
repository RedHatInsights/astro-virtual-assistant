        Here is how the process works:
        1. I will open a link to sso.redhat.com for you.
        2. In that page, there will be a section named **Two-factor authentication**.
        3. In that section, there is a button named **Set up Authenticator application**.
        4. Once you click that button, you will be asked to reauthenticate.
        5. After you reauthenticate, you will be redirected to a form to set up two-factor authentication.

        5. Once you click this button, it will ask you to confirm.
        6. After you confirm, your two-factor authentication will be disabled for your particular device.
