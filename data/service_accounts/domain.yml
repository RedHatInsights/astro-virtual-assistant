        In order to update your API configurations to use Service Accounts, you'll need to obtain an access token.
        I can provide you with information on how to do this, or walk you through the steps.
        How would you like to proceed?

        Before we update your API integration, let's make sure you have your service account credentials.
        These provide a secure way for your application to connect to our APIs.
        Do you have your service account's client ID and secret ready?

        Ok. Please get them and come back when you are ready.
        If you need the client ID, visit [console.redhat.com/iam/service-accounts](console.redhat.com/iam/service-accounts).
        If you need to reset your credentials for the secret, you can do that through the interface too.

        **Replace Placeholders**:
        Make sure to replace `yyyy` with your service account's client ID and `xxx` with its client secret.

        **Parameters referece**:
        - `client_id` and `client_secret`: These identify your application to Red Hat SSO.
        - `grant_type`: Specifies you want the Client Credentials Grant.
        - `scope`: Defines the API permissions you need.

    - text: "Red Hat SSO will respond with a JSON object containing an access token. You can use this to make authenticated requests to APIs."

        Now you'll want to test your integration. Here's an example call using the Ingress API.

        Remember to replace `${access_token}` with the actual token you received.
  utter_got_service_account_creds_7:
    - text: |
        `curl 'https://console.redhat.com/api/ingress/v1' -H 'accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}"`

        One final and important note:
          Access tokens expire after 15 minutes. You'll need to repeat the token request process roughly every 10 minutes to keep a fresh token. This is a standard security practice.
