# Internal UI for Virtual Assistant

This UI is used as an internal tool to follow up conversations and being able to understand more effectively the way
virtual assistant is being used.

## Working locally

You will have to setup a full local environment to be able to work on this tool. At very least we need a Rasa tracker
database with data on it.

## Running

After having a local tracker store with data on it, start the internal server and follow with:

- Install all the dependencies (`npm install`)
- Run the dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Open the displayed local url on your favorite browser.
